Welcome to my dotfiles!

## For Non-Nix Users
There are also dotfiles for you! Just look after directories which are named
`config`. For example the [`config/`] directory in my repository, there are
my "real" dotfiles which you might more expect.

[`config/`]: https://github.com/TornaxO7/dotfiles/tree/main/config
